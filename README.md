# Snake
Cycles is a game based on the good old Tron Lightbike arcade game. Two players control their cycles, leaving a trail behind them. The first player to crash into either player's trail loses. The score increases for each direction change, and the winner gets bonus points.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 cse210-05 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
